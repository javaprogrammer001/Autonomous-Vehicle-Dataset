# Overview

This dataset is created for lane detection in autonomous vehicles. It can be used to train and evaluate models that predict the lane positions, helping vehicles navigate and drive automatically.

The dataset contains frames extracted from videos, with each frame having:

- Original frame – the raw image from the vehicle’s camera.
- Lane-detected frame – the same frame with lane markings highlighted, suitable for supervised learning.

This dataset is ideal for tasks such as:

- Lane detection and segmentation
- Autonomous driving research
- Vehicle path prediction

# Usage

You can use this dataset to train models that:

- Predict lane positions from images
- Assist in vehicle navigation systems
- Develop autonomous driving algorithms
